## Potential Technologies used:

1. React
2. So place to store the projects list, DB document store or sql.
3. NodeJS backend or other backend technology
4. Some technology for login, Firebase, Oauth/passport, or something similar.

## Ideas/steps for the app:

1. Select project name on the left and see its details on the right pane.
2. Add a new project by clicking the plus button on right, project will be associated w/ signed in user
3. Oauth login for Google account
4. You can click the minus to delete your projects and they will disappear immediately.
5. Sorting and Searching of projects. Sorted by type of Open source or private
6. Form for User to enter in a new project.

## Tasks to start working on:

1. Overall design and mocking of the app(User Stories)
2. Data design, how the projects will be stored and what technology.
3. User Login ( Form ?) 
4. React App with basic functionality, including (huh ?)
5. Deployment of the app on some host, or dockerize the app, maybe Digital Ocean.
6. Form input of new projects and how to handle the input.
7. Add ability to test, lets start doing this from the start, unit test everything.
