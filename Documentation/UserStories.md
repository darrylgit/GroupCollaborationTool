## Tasks to start working on[break me down into actionable tasks]:
1. Overall design and mocking of the app
2. Data design, how the projects will be stored and what technology
3. User Login
4. React App with basic functionality, including
5. Deployment of the app on some host, or dockerize the app, maybe Digital ocean
6. Form input of new projects and how to handle the input
7. Add ability to test, lets start doing this from the start, unit test everything.
